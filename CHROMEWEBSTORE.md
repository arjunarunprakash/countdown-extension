## Store Listing

**Extension Name**
Countdown

**Short Description** (matches manifest.json's description; 131 of 132 characters)
See how long you really have until every deadline and exam. Live countdowns in Chrome's side panel. Your data stays on your device.

**Detailed Description** (plain text; the store strips Markdown)

```
Countdown shows exactly how long you have left until every deadline and event, right in Chrome's side panel.

I made it for myself. If your brain works a bit like mine (a little ADHD, maybe), it's hard to feel how close something really is when it's just a block on a calendar. "Due Friday" doesn't land the way "2 days left" does. So I built a simple panel that sits beside whatever I'm working on, pulls in my calendar, and turns every deadline and exam into a live countdown. No more digging through my calendar to work out how much time I've got.

Countdown is made by one person, and it keeps everything on your device. There's no account, no server, no analytics and no tracking.

WHAT IT DOES
• Live countdowns in days, hours, minutes or seconds, for deadlines and events
• Brings in your calendar: .ics files or Google, Apple and Outlook calendar links, with duplicates spotted for you
• Colour-coded categories for each course, project or trip, with drag and drop
• Repeating items, like weekly homework numbered Chapter 4, 5, 6 and so on
• A toolbar icon that shows the time left until your next deadline (you can switch this off if it stresses you out)
• Seven colour themes in light and dark, full keyboard support, and screen reader friendly

GETTING STARTED
1. Pin Countdown and click its icon to open the side panel.
2. Click + to add a deadline, or Import to bring in your calendar.
3. Use the arrow next to + to make categories, then drag items into them.

YOUR PRIVACY
Everything you add stays in Chrome on your own device. None of it is sent to me or anyone else, and there's nothing to sign up for. Countdown asks for no access to websites when you install it. If you import a calendar link, Chrome asks whether Countdown may read that one site, and that's the only site it ever contacts.

FROM ME
Countdown is a one-person project, built and looked after by me. If something's broken or you have an idea, I'd love to hear it: https://github.com/arjunarunprakash/countdown-extension/issues

I hope it helps you as much as it helps me.

### Screenshot Notes

Following the store's [listing guidance](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/best-listing): five full-bleed 1280×800 images with square corners, one feature each, a short headline and one line of text, a single callout pointing at the feature, and branding that matches the icon. Every panel image is a real capture of the current build, not a mock-up. Upload them in this order:

1. **Every deadline, counting down.** The panel docked beside a course page in Chrome, with the toolbar icon's "2d" badge called out.
2. **Colour-coded categories.** Mid-drag: "Flight to Lisbon → Personal", with the Personal section lit as the drop target.
3. **Repeats that number themselves.** A weekly "Chapter {n} Homework" series open, listing Chapter 4–9 with their dates.
4. **Bring in any calendar.** An import preview: three new events marked Import and one greyed out as Already added.
5. **Make it yours.** Lagoon (light) with Appearance open beside Orchid (dark), and three toolbar icons sweeping from 9d to 5h.

The promo tile and marquee use the saturated accent gradient (not white or light grey), the logo and name, and little text, so they read at half size.

**Regenerating** after UI changes: with a build served by `vite preview --port 4173`, run `bash scripts/screenshots.sh`. `store-assets/scenes.mjs` loads each scene's data into the real panel and performs the interaction; `store-assets/render.mjs` composes the final images.

## Permissions Justification

| Permission | Type | Justification |
|------------|------|---------------|
| `sidePanel` | permissions | Countdown's whole interface is a side panel. Clicking the toolbar icon opens it beside the current page so the user can watch their countdowns while browsing. |
| `storage` | permissions | Saves the user's deadlines, events, repeat rules, categories, completion history and display settings locally on their device (`chrome.storage.local`), so they persist between sessions. Nothing is synced or sent anywhere. |
| `https://*/*` | optional_host_permissions | Not granted at install. Requested only when the user pastes a calendar link (for example a Google Calendar "Secret address in iCal format") and presses Fetch. Chrome then asks for that one site (and its subdomains, because calendar servers redirect between them, e.g. p52-caldav.icloud.com). The extension downloads that single .ics file, without cookies, to show an import preview. No other request is made to the site and no page content is read. |
| `alarms` | permissions | Redraws the toolbar icon at the moment its badge or countdown sweep should next change (for example when "3d" becomes "2d"), even while the side panel is closed. No data leaves the device. |
| `offscreen` | permissions | Extension background scripts can't read whether Chrome is in light or dark mode, so a small hidden page (offscreen reason MATCH_MEDIA) reports it, letting the toolbar icon match the toolbar it sits on. The page does nothing else and makes no network requests. |

Remote code: none. All JavaScript is bundled in the package; the extension never loads or evaluates remote scripts.

## Privacy & Data Use

### Data Collection

**Does the extension collect user data?** No.

The items, categories and settings the user creates are stored only on their device, and the developer never receives them. Calendar links are fetched directly from the calendar server the user chose; nothing is sent to the developer or any third party.

| Data Type | Collected? | Transmitted Off-Device? | Purpose | Shared with Third Parties? |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Personally identifiable info | No | No | — | No |
| Health info | No | No | — | No |
| Financial info | No | No | — | No |
| Authentication info | No | No | — | No |
| Personal communications | No | No | — | No |
| Location | No | No | — | No |
| Web history | No | No | — | No |
| User activity | No | No | — | No |
| Website content | No | No | — | No |

### Data Use Certification
- [x] Data is NOT sold to third parties
- [x] Data is NOT used for purposes unrelated to the extension's core functionality
- [x] Data is NOT used for creditworthiness or lending purposes

| 1.0.0 | 2026-10-24 | First release: live countdowns, repeating items, categories, import/export, seven colour themes, live toolbar icon | Published |

## Review Notes

### Releasing an update

1. Bump the version in `package.json` and `public/manifest.json` (`npm version <x.y.z> --no-git-tag-version` updates package.json and its lockfile). The store rejects a version that isn't higher than the published one.
2. Run `npm run package`, then `npm run check:extension` to load that exact build in Chrome and check the worker, toolbar icon and permissions.
3. In the developer dashboard, open Countdown › **Package** › **Upload new package** and upload `release/countdown-v<version>.zip`. Update the **Store listing** tab too if the description or images changed, then **Submit for review**.
4. If the update adds a permission that shows a warning, Chrome disables the extension for existing users until they accept it. Avoid that where possible: request it as an optional permission at the moment it's needed, as calendar-site access already is.
5. Add a row to Version History. Once approved, Chrome updates installed copies automatically within a few hours; installed data and settings carry over.

### Packaging
`npm run package` builds and writes `release/countdown-v<version>.zip` with `manifest.json` at its root. It refuses to package when manifest.json and package.json versions differ, or when the build contains source maps or the dev-only audit script. Bump both versions before every upload; the store rejects a version that isn't higher than the published one.

### Known Issues / Limitations
- Calendar links are imported once; there's no automatic refresh.

### Rejection History
None yet.
